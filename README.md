River Thames Water Level Analysis

- Overview
This project analyzes water level data from the River Thames, specifically at the London Bridge location. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization of water level distributions during high and low tides, boxplots for min, max, and outliers, and an exploration of monthly trends and autocorrelation.

- Data
The water level data is sourced from the River Thames monitoring station at London Bridge. The dataset includes datetime, water level, and high tide indicator columns.

- Data Cleaning
The cleaning process involves removing unnecessary columns, renaming columns for clarity, converting datetime to the correct format, and handling data types and missing values.

- Visualization
Visualizations are created to explore the distribution of water levels during high and low tides. Histograms provide an overview, and boxplots illustrate the range and outliers. Additionally, the project explores monthly trends for specific years.

- Trend Analysis
The project calculates and plots the ratio of high tide days each year, providing insights into the frequency of high tide occurrences. Similarly, the ratio of low tide days is analyzed, highlighting periods of lower water levels.

- Autocorrelation
Autocorrelation analysis is conducted using a function that calculates the autocorrelation of water levels for different resampling levels. The results offer insights into temporal patterns in water level data.
